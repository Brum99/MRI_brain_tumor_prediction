# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification with Deep Learning

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) powered model to classify MRI brain scans into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**.

Built and trained in Google Colab using a Tesla T4 GPU on a public brain MRI dataset, achieving **98.6% test accuracy**.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brum99/MRI_brain_tumor_prediction.git
cd MRI_brain_tumor_prediction
```

2. Open one of the training notebooks located in
   `MRI_CNN_Architectures/notebooks/`:

   - `xception_training.ipynb`
   - `efficientnet_training.ipynb`
   - `custom_cnn_training.ipynb`

   Each notebook loads the data generators, builds the corresponding model
   architecture, trains the network and saves evaluation plots.
